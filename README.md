## Technologies used

- **React**, could have easily used vanilla javascript for this particular project but i was tasked to do this with reactjs and i'm glad i did because i am able to solidify some new concept i recently learnt in react, concept like react portal
- **TypeScript**, used typescript because i want to get use to using types and interfaces
- **Tailwind css**, for css ,in Thomas Shelby's voice, because i can because i fucking can, and serious it make writing css alot easier
- **Netlify**, for live hosting
