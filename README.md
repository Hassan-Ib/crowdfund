## Technologies used

- **React**
  I could have easily used vanilla javascript for this particular project but i was tasked to do this with reactjs and i'm glad i did because i am able to solidify some new concept i recently learnt in react, concept like react portal
- **TypeScript**
  Used typescript because i want to get use to using types and interfaces
- **Tailwind css**
  In Thomas Shelby's voice "because i can because i fucking can", serious it make writing css alot easier
- **Netlify**
  For live hosting

## Challengies and how i went about solving it
